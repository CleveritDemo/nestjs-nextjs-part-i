# Developer Documentation for NestJS App

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers working on the NestJS application focused on managing products. It includes details on the project structure, setup instructions, and key components.

## Project Structure

The application is structured as follows:

nestjs-app ├── .env # Environment variables ├── .gitignore # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore ├── package.json # Project metadata and dependencies ├── README.md # Project overview and general documentation ├── tsconfig.json # TypeScript compiler configuration ├── src │ ├── app.module.ts # Root module of the application │ ├── config │ │ └── typeorm.config.ts # TypeORM configuration │ ├── main.ts # Entry point of the application │ └── products │ ├── dto │ │ ├── create-product.dto.ts # DTO for creating a product │ │ └── update-product.dto.ts # DTO for updating a product │ ├── openai.service.ts # Service for OpenAI integration (hypothetical) │ ├── product.entity.ts # Product entity definition │ ├── product.seeder.ts # Seeder for initial product data (hypothetical) │ ├── products.controller.ts # Controller for product-related routes │ ├── products.module.ts # Module for the products feature │ └── products.service.ts # Service for product-related business logic └── dist # Compiled JavaScript files (ignored by git)


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and update the environment variables according to your local setup.
4. **Database Setup**: Ensure your database is running and accessible. Run the TypeORM commands to set up the database schema.
5. **Start the Application**: Use `npm start` to run the application. For development, you can use `npm run start:dev` to start the application in watch mode.

## Key Components

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Located in `src/products/dto`, these classes define the structure of data for creating and updating products.
- **Entity**: The `Product` entity in `src/products/product.entity.ts` represents the product table in the database.
- **Service**: The `ProductsService` in `src/products/products.service.ts` contains the business logic for managing products.
- **Controller**: The `ProductsController` in `src/products/products.controller.ts` handles incoming requests and returns responses to the client.
- **Module**: The `ProductsModule` in `src/products/products.module.ts` organizes the product feature by importing and providing the necessary controllers and services.

## Development Tips

- **Swagger Documentation**: The application is configured with Swagger. Visit `/api` on the running application to view the API documentation.
- **TypeORM CLI**: Use the TypeORM CLI commands defined in `package.json` for database migrations and schema synchronization.

## Testing

Currently, no tests are specified. Implement unit and integration tests in the `test` directory following the NestJS testing guidelines.
